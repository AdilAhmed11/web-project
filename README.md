# 🌐 Web Project

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to my **very first project!** 🎉🎉🎉

This is a portfolio page, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, introducing myself and highlighting key skills I have and projects that I've accomplished.

## ℹ️ Overview

This portfolio page is built using:

-   **HTML**
-   **SCSS**

SCSS (Sassy CSS) extends CSS with powerful features, making it easier to write, maintain, and scale styles. SCSS also lets you nest selectors, making styles more readable and organised.

I have also followed **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology in this project.

This project was managed using Git version control and collaborate on web development.

## 🔍 Features

Sections:

-   Intro
-   About Me: Overview of my experience thus far
-   Technical Skills: Languages and skills
-   Projects: Preview and links to my projects
-   Contact: Email and social media links

The page is:

-   Responsive design, optimised for mobile and desktop experiences
-   User-friendly UX
-   Interactive with hover effects and connectivity

## 🔮 Future

As I grow as a developer and gain more experience, I'd like to make the following updates:

-   🤖 Make the page interactive using **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
-   🎨 Improve the **design** and **functionality** of the website.
-   ✅ Add to the list of projects, which include **\_nology** and _Personal_ projects.
