# Web Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my **very first project!**

This is a portfolio page, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, introducing myself and highlighting key skills I have and projects that I've accomplished.

## Overview

This portfolio page is built using:

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS & SCSS**

SCSS (Sassy CSS) extends CSS with powerful features, making it easier to write, maintain, and scale styles. SCSS also lets you nest selectors, making styles more readable and organised.

I have also followed **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology in this project.

## Future

As I grow as a developer and gain more experience, I'd like to make the following updates:

-   Make the page interactive using **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
-   Improve the **design** and **functionality** of the website.
-   Add to the list of my individual projects, that I do with **\_nology** and personal ones.

Thank you for visiting!
