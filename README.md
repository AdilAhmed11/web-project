# 🌐 Web Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my **very first project!** 🎉🎉🎉

This is a portfolio page, hosted on **GitHub Pages**, introducing myself and highlighting key skills I have and projects that I've accomplished.

## ℹ️ Overview

This portfolio page is built using:

-   **HTML**
-   **CSS & SCSS**

SCSS (Sassy CSS) extends CSS with powerful features, making it easier to write, maintain, and scale styles. SCSS also lets you nest selectors, making styles more readable and organised.

I have also followed **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** methodology in this project.

## 🔮 Future

As I grow as a developer and gain more experience, I'd like to make the following updates:

-   🤖 Make the page interactive using **JavaScript** and **TypeScript**.
-   🎨 Improve the **design** and **functionality** of the website.
-   ✅ Add to the list of projects, which include **\_nology** and _Personal_ projects.

Thank you for visiting! 😀
